# Roadmap

**Typetta's** core team works on the consolidation and evolution of the product with a priority ladder mainly dictated by user requests. Our roadmap is used both internally and externally as a reference for new features, but may be subject to change for both technical and strategic reasons.

If you think there is an urgent feature or fix, which should be considered as soon as possible, we invite you to create an issue or open a discussion onTypetta's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/twinlogix/typetta).

The best way to consult our roadmap is to consult the [milestones on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/twinlogix/typetta/milestones) and the issues connected to them.
